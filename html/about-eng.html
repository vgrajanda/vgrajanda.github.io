                <p>
                    Hello! Thank you very much for visiting my website. I am a 23 year old passionate about technology. 
                    I graduated from the Autonomous University of Aguascalientes and I am currently looking for a Job 
                    as a Devops Engineer or Cloud Engineer. I am a big fan of video games (I would like to be able to develop one someday) 
                    as well as learning new things about technology. Among my main hobbies within technology are:

                    <ul class="hobbies-list">
                        <li>AWS</li>
                        <li>Docker</li>
                        <li>Terraform</li>
                        <li>Technological infrastructure</li>
                        <li>Linux</li>
                        <li>Networking</li>
                        <li>Programming</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2 class="name">Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    
                    I have worked formally for over a year in the industry; the job I have enjoyed the most has been developing 
                    roles mainly related to Linux server infrastructure. This work lasted for a year. I worked as a Linux Administrator providing 24/7 
                    support to Linux servers. In addition, in this job, we performed DevOps L1 and L2 activities, such as deploying 
                    code versions, using Jenkins for work with CI/CD pipelines, manual log searches through bash and Splunk and monitoring
                    resources with Grafana.
                    <br><br>

                    Self-taught, some of the things I have given myself the opportunity to learn about Devops and Linux
                    (with different distributions such as CentOS, RedHat, Fedora, Ubuntu Server and Debian) include

                    <ul class="hobbies-list">
                        <li>Deployment of web application with Docker and Kubernetes</li>
                        <li>Creation of a DEV environment with Terraform and AWS</li>
                        <li>Hosting web pages with Apache and MySQL services</li>
                        <li>Hosting video game servers to play with friends by configuring them from scratch</li>
                        <li>
                            Create virtual machines for hosting different applications and operating systems; both in controlled environments and open to the
                            local network
                        </li>
                        <li>I've worked with networks locally, managing Firewalls within Linux Servers (ufw, firewallcmd)</li>
                    </ul>
